## Read-in Data

The data needs to be created before running this code! The script to create the data is in the `billboard_100.R` file which can be run easily after you have installed all of the project dependencies! After you have created the data, you can read it in using the following code:

```{r}
top_billboard_ranking <- readRDS("top_billboard_ranking.rds")
```

If you have created the data, then try to render this document with the Render button in RStudio to see the analysis!

  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top_100)) %>%

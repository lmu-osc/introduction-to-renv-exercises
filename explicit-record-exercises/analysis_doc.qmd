## Example of Needing {maps} Package from Suggests of {ggplot2}

Call in the ggplot2 package 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Call map data using the map_data() function

```{r}
(world_map <- map_data("world"))
```

This will result in an error because the data for these maps is in the {maps} package, which is in the suggests of ggplot2. To fix this, you will need to record the {maps} in your `renv.lock` file.

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon() 
```

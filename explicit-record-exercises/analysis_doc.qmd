## Quarto

The analysis below uses the `fa()` function from the `psych` package to perform a factor analysis on the `Holzinger` dataset. The `nfactors` argument specifies the number of factors to extract, `fm` specifies the method of factor extraction, and `rotate` specifies the rotation method.

No worries at all if you're not familiar with factor analysis! For the purposes of this exercise, only {renv}-related issues are important.

```{r}
library(psych)
fa(Holzinger, nfactors = 2, fm = "ml", rotate = "promax")
```
